## Info on rePub

https://github.com/hafaio/repub

A reMarkable ePub generator. This is essentially an open source version of
[Read on reMarkable](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh).
In contast to that extension, this will include images in the generated ePub
files. It originally offered more configuration options over the original
extension, but those are disabled until a new API can be found.

However this doesn't replicate the printer adapter, so if you want to upload
PDFs it still recommended to keep the Read on reMarkable extension for those
uploads.
